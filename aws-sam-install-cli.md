To install AWS SAM CLI on macOS 14, follow these steps:

1. Install Homebrew:

Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that allows you to easily install and manage software on your system. To install Homebrew, open a terminal window and paste the following command:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
2. Install AWS SAM CLI:

Once Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install AWS SAM CLI. Run the following command:
```
brew install aws-sam-cli
```
This will install the AWS SAM CLI on your system.
3. Validate the installation:

Once the installation is complete, you can validate that the AWS SAM CLI is working correctly by running the following command:
```
sam --version
```
This should display the version of the AWS SAM CLI that you have installed.
4. Set up your AWS credentials:

Before you can use the AWS SAM CLI, you need to set up your AWS credentials. You can do this by creating a new file called `~/.aws/credentials` and adding your access key and secret key to it. Here's an example of what the file might look like:
```
[default]
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
```
Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your actual AWS credentials.
5. Use the AWS SAM CLI:

Now that you have the AWS SAM CLI installed and your credentials set up, you can use the `sam` command to create, deploy, and manage your AWS services. For example, to create a new AWS Lambda function, you can run the following command:
```
sam init --name my-function
```
This will create a new directory called `my-function` containing the basic files and folders for a Lambda function.
