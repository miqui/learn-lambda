Step-by-step guide to deploy a Python 3 Lambda function using AWS SAM CLI, along with a project layout that can be pushed to GitHub:


Project Layout:
----------------

Here's the project layout for this tutorial:
```markdown
my-sam-project/
├── hello_world.py
├── sam.yaml
├── .gitignore
└── README.md
```
* `hello_world.py` contains the Python code for the Lambda function.
* `sam.yaml` contains the SAM configuration for the function.
* `.gitignore` specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
* `README.md` contains information about the project.

Step 1: Create a new SAM project

* First, create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:
```bash
mkdir my-sam-project
cd my-sam-project
```
* Initialize a new SAM project:
```
sam init --name hello-world
cd hello-world
```
Step 2: Create a Python function

* Inside the `hello-world` directory, create a new file called `hello_world.py` and add the following code:
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': 'Hello, World!'
    }
```
Step 3: Configure the function

* Create a new file called `sam.yaml` in the root of the project directory and add the following configuration:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'

Resources:
  HelloWorldFunction:
    Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
    Properties:
      CodeUri: .
      Handler: hello_world.handler
      Runtime: python3.8
      Events:
        HelloWorldApi:
          Type: Api
          Properties:
            Path: /
            Method: ANY
```
Step 4: Create a `.gitignore` file

* Create a `.gitignore` file in the root of the project directory and add the following:
```
.vscode/
```
Step 5: Commit and push to GitHub

* Commit the changes to your local repository:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```
* Push the changes to GitHub:
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/hello-world.git
git push -u origin master
```
Step 6: Deploy to AWS

* Deploy the function to AWS using the following command:
```
sam deploy --guided
```
This will prompt you to enter information about your AWS account and the function. Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.

Step 7: Test the function

* Once the deployment is complete, you can test the function by running the following command:
```
sam invoke --function-name HelloWorldFunction
```
This will invoke the function and return the "Hello, World!" response.

Step 8: Create an API Gateway endpoint

* You can also create an API Gateway endpoint for your function by adding the following configuration to the `sam.yaml` file:
```yaml
Events:
  HelloWorldApi:
    Type: Api
    Properties:
      Path: /
      Method: ANY
```
* After updating the `sam.yaml` file, re-run the `sam deploy` command to update the function and the API Gateway endpoint.

Step 9: Test the API Gateway endpoint

* Once the deployment is complete, you can test the API Gateway endpoint by running the following command:
```
sam local start-api
```
This will start a local API Gateway server that you can use to test the endpoint.

* Open a web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. This should display the "Hello, World!" response.

That's it! You've successfully deployed a Python 3 Lambda function using AWS SAM CLI and created an API Gateway endpoint for it. You can now use this function as a trigger for other AWS services or as a standalone API endpoint.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
